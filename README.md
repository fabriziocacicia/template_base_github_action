# Base Template Github Action
The base template that all the Github Actions should create from.

## Features
- PR Auto Labeler: automatically labels all PRs based on their type specified in the title (chore:, docs:, feat:, etc...)
- `.gitignore`: exclude all the most common file generated by the JetBrains IDEs and macOS specific files
- Keep History Conventional: keeps in the commits history of the `main` branch only the commits that follows the [Conventional Commits][1] convention
- Conventional PR Titles: checks that the title of PRs follows the [Conventional Commits][1] convention
- Self Test Workflow: a workflow to test the action locally without the need to publishing it to the Marketplace and using on another repository
